# DraggingStar
- Java program to allow the user to “grab” a vertex of the polygon above and drag it.  
- Each vertex should be “draggable”.
- A click on the green square will allow the vertex to be draggable again.

Missing: Make the squares that delimit where the vertex is clickable to move with the vertex rather than staying static.
